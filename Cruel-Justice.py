    "summary": "The unsolved double murder of 14-year-old Aarushi Talwar and her family's domestic helper, Hemraj Banjade. The case was marred by a botched initial investigation, multiple changes in investigation teams (from local police to CBI), and intense media sensationalism, leading to the parents' conviction and subsequent acquittal.",

    "laws": "IPC Section 302 (Murder), IPC Section 201 (Destruction of evidence), IPC Section 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention)",
    "real_outcome": "The parents were acquitted, but the 'benefit of doubt' verdict meant the murders remain officially unsolved, leaving a cloud of mystery and public debate.",
    "ai_opinion": "This case exposed significant systemic flaws in forensic investigation, crime scene management, and the detrimental influence of a 'media trial'. AI emphasizes the critical need for meticulous, unbiased police work, free from external pressures, to ensure justice is not compromised by procedural failures."
